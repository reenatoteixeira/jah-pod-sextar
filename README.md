# 🎉 Jah Pod Sextar?

"Jah pod sextar?" is a fun web application that humorously determines whether it's time to start celebrating the
weekend. The idea came up during a casual joke with my coworkers, where we would often ask each other "Já pode sextar?"
every Friday to see if the weekend mood was officially allowed to begin. This app brings that fun tradition to life!

## 🇧🇷 What is "Sextar"?

In Brazilian culture, "sextar" is derived from "sexta-feira" (Friday) and is widely used to express excitement for the
weekend. People often say "hoje é dia de sextar!" when they're ready to finish work or studies and start unwinding.
Essentially, "sextar" means to begin enjoying Friday — whether by relaxing, going out, or just getting into the weekend
vibe.

## 🇺🇸 Equivalent Expression in the U.S.

In the United States, a similar phrase would be "It's finally Friday!" or "TGIF" (Thank God It's Friday). While "TGIF"
focuses on relief from the workweek, "sextar" is more about actively celebrating the arrival of Friday.

## 🚀 How It Works

- The app checks the current day and time.
- It fetches predefined responses stored in a JSON file.
- Depending on the day and time, it delivers a playful message.
- If it’s Friday after noon, the app confirms that it’s time to “sextar!” with a festive message. 🎉
- If it's not quite time, the app will show a funny or slightly disappointing reply. 😅
